const description = `Cancel a staged command that has not been executed.

This can be done as the issuer of a command to revoke it if there was
an error while issuing it, or for a properly permissioned user to
explicitly deny a command to be run.

This does not remove the command from the audit history, but it does
mark it as deleted and prevent it from being scheduled for execution.

Commands that are already running or have already completed cannot be
canceled.
